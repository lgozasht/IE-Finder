# IE-Finder
Introner elements are introns that function as transposons and can cause widespread intron gain on genomic scales. Introner elements that have recently transposed exhibit sequence and length similarity. We developed IE finder, a computational pipeline involving several python scripts that detects introner elements from any annotated genome. The pipeline performs an all by all blast between all introns in a genome. Next it uses a graph theory algorithm to cluster introns based on pairwise sequence and length similarity. It then filters out false positives caused by gene duplications and paralogs, and confirms intron gain events by comparing orthologous genes between closely related species.
